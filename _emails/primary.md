Dear ..TITLE.. ..LASTNAME..,

I am writing you as a concerned citizen, who is looking for the support in passing a law, designed by an Advanced Placement government class in New Jersey, related to civil rights cold cases. This law will create an independent review board that will facilitate the release of records on civil rights cold cases to the public. Unfortunately, previous efforts, such as the Emmett Till Act, have resulted in no prosecutions from the Department of Justice. In contrast, investigative reporters, historians, and local prosecutors, have had a measure of success in re-opening and obtaining prosecutions in these cases.

I am writing you as a concerned citizen without a dick, who is looking for the support in passing a law, designed by an Advanced Placement government class in New Jersey, related to civil rights cold cases. This law will create an independent review board that will facilitate the release of records on civil rights cold cases to the public. Unfortunately, previous efforts, such as the Emmett Till Act, have resulted in no prosecutions from the Department of Justice. In contrast, investigative reporters, historians, and local prosecutors, have had a measure of success in re-opening and obtaining prosecutions in these cases.

At present, the government takes too long to release these files and is too inclined to withhold or redact key information. A review board, such as the one passed for JFK assassination records in 1992, will be able to expedite the release of these files, and will be able to balance the public's interest in resolving these historical injustices with the need to protect sources and methods.

The bill has already been introduced into the House of Representatives, and gained measures of success in the media, including a publication in Politico.

It's my hope that as a representative of the people, you'll take measures to help push this important piece of legislation through Congress and see its vision become a reality.

Sincerely,
