No. Part of the bill allows the president to override any decision of the review board. 

The law is modeled after the kennedy assassination records collection act of 1992, which created a similar review board for the Kennedy assassination. 
Since 1992, between the FBI and CIA there has only ever been one challenge on a review board decision, and that challenge was dropped and the document released before presidental intervention was sought. 

This medium of reviewing and releasing information has proven extremely effective in the past.
