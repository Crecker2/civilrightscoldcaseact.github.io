title: What's wrong with FOIA?
---
The current system of obtaining documents—Freedom of Information Act requests, or FOIA—is slow, leads to significant <span id="slateLink">[over-redaction](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/10/03/justice_department_guilty_of_overclassifying_documents_internal_audit_finds.html)</span> and makes it difficult for private investigators to solve these cases. To make matters worse, the Department of Justice is ineffective at solving these cases. When tasked with solving 126 cases under the Emmet Till Act, closed 113 of these cases without resolution. An additional 8 were handed down to the states, meaning the FBI no longer involved itself with them.
